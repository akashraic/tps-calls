These calls include incidents such as arrests, gun calls, collisions involving people or property, assaults, industrial accidents or disputes. Some calls for service will be, or are being, excluded for privacy reasons, including calls respecting domestic violence, sexual assault, or medical distress. Others calls may be excluded because they are part of an ongoing police operation.">
